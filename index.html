            <div class="star-block">
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> At Cosgrove Leisure, the sales team struggled to create on-brand marketing materials due to limited design skills. This led to inconsistent branding and a less professional image.</p>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> I needed to develop a solution that ensured brand consistency in sales materials while being easy for non-designers to use.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I designed user-friendly overlay templates for Canva and PowerPoint, incorporating our brand colors, fonts, and layouts. I also created a guide on using these templates and held training sessions for the sales team.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> This initiative achieved brand consistency across all sales materials. It also reduced the design team's workload by 40% and empowered the sales team to independently create professional-looking content.</p>

                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> When I joined Cosgrove Leisure, we had multiple outdated websites with poor user experience, slow load times, and poor lead generation.</p>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> My task was to improve our web presence and lead generation within a limited budget.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I implemented a WordPress solution using Elementor and the Houzez theme, customized for our holiday park sales. I integrated our CRM, created an easy-to-use listing management system, added a booking system, and consolidated all parks under one website.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> These changes significantly improved our search engine rankings, increased lead generation, and boosted sales. We achieved a more professional online presence, comparable to larger competitors, despite budget constraints.</p>

                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> At Cosgrove Leisure, I managed several digital projects simultaneously, including a website redesign, branding updates, and creating marketing collateral. The challenge was compounded by limited digital infrastructure and communication systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> I needed to coordinate these projects efficiently, keep stakeholders aligned, and meet tight deadlines.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I used Trello for visual project management, adopted an Agile-like approach with sprints and deadlines, and used WhatsApp for communication. I also established regular milestone reviews.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> This led to more streamlined workflows, fewer revision cycles, improved stakeholder engagement, and on-time delivery of all major projects, including the website revamp, marketing materials, and branding updates.</p>

                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> When presenting creative concepts for landing pages to non-design stakeholders, static mockups often led to misunderstandings and lengthy revisions.</p>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> I aimed to improve how we visualized concepts to stakeholders, streamline the feedback process, and reduce wasted development time.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> I started creating quick interactive prototypes using the Relume Library. This allowed stakeholders to interact with the designs early on. I also implemented early prototype reviews and facilitated hands-on demonstrations.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> This approach resulted in faster revision cycles, a quicker approval process, and better stakeholder buy-in, as the interactive prototypes made the design concepts much clearer.</p>
